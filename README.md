Industry project challenge sponsored by Open Avenues. 

The task at hand in this project was extracting the correct fields from radiology reports, using natural language processing and machine learning tools and libraries. The goal was, given a text, to correctly classify that text into one of four fields (exam, findings, clinicaldata, impression). The dataset consisted of 987 radiology reports, structured in a folder of json files.

Machine learning libraries used include sklearn, gensim, and nltk.
