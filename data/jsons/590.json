FINDINGS: Lungs/Pleura: There is mild diffuse interstitial prominence. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinum: Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal. Mediastinal contour is within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable. Other: Sternal wires are intact. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild diffuse interstitial prominence, which may represent mild interstitial edema or atypical pneumonia. 2. No radiographic evidence for congestive heart failure.
