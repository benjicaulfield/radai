{"ReportText": "EXAM: CHEST RADIOGRAPHY EXAM DATE: 07/15/2018 05:30 AM. CLINICAL HISTORY: On ventilator. COMPARISON: 07/14/2018. TECHNIQUE: 1 view. FINDINGS: Support apparatus: Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 2.9 cm above the carina. Enteric tube extends below the diaphragm and off the inferior margin of the image. Right IJ central venous catheter tip is in the middle third of the SVC, unchanged. Lungs/Pleura: There is similar appearance of diffuse bilateral interstitial and airspace opacities. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinum: Within exam limitations, the cardiomediastinal contour is normal. Other: The patient is post median sternotomy with intact sternal cerclage wires. No acute osseous abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. Similar appearance of diffuse bilateral interstitial and airspace opacities. 2. Support apparatus in similar position.
