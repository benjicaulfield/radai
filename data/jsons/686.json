FINDINGS: Lungs/Pleura: Similar degree and distribution of the multifocal airspace opacities in both lungs. No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Mediastinum: Within exam limitations, the cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable. Other: Endotracheal tube tip located 5.0 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm into the region of the stomach with tip off the confines of the film. Right IJ catheter tip located in the region of the junction of the SVC and right atrium. IMPRESSION: Similar appearance of the multifocal airspace disease. Support hardware are located in standard positions, as described above.
