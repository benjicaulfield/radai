FINDINGS: Lungs/Pleura: Mildly low lung volumes with mild crowding. Mild crowding. Small amount of opacity persists at the bases with mild decrease at the left apex. No large effusion. No pneumothorax. Mediastinum: Cardiac silhouette size appears stable. Stable prior sternotomy changes. Other: None. IMPRESSION: 1. Mildly lower lung volumes with mild increased crowding and small amount of opacity at the left apex that may reflect a combination of atelectasis, edema, and/or pneumonia in the proper settings. 2. Left-sided pleural drain remains in place. No pneumothorax identified. ", "findings": "FINDINGS: Lungs/Pleura: Mildly low lung volumes with mild crowding. Mild crowding.
