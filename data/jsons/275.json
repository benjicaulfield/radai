{"ReportText": "Chest, one view. History: Shortness of breath. Comparison: Chest radiograph from earlier in the day. A frontal view of the chest was obtained. There is diffuse haziness of the lungs. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size. There is no acute osseous abnormality. Impression: Diffuse haziness of the lungs may be due to overlying soft tissue. The films and dictation have been reviewed with the Resident and I agree with the findings.", "findings": "A frontal view of the chest was obtained. There is diffuse haziness of the lungs.
