FINDINGS: Lungs/Pleura: Bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left, are similar compared with the prior exam. No increasing pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Mediastinum: Within exam limitations, the cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Other: Endotracheal tube tip is 4.8 cm above the carina. Enteric tube tip is in the proximal stomach. Right internal jugular catheter tip in the upper SVC. Right PICC line tip in the lower SVC. IMPRESSION: 1.
